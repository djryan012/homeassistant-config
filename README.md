This is my configuration for Home Assistant.

I'm currently running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) version __0.100.2__ with the Hassio OS.  (https://home-assistant.io/hassio/). I have moved all files that would use the "!include" syntax to there own folder for better orginization and quicker editing.
