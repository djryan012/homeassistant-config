This is my configuration for Home Assistant.

I'm currently running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) version __0.93.1__ with the Hassio OS. Started using Home Assistant from the Hassbian image and switch back to HassIO install now that its more stable. (https://home-assistant.io/hassio/). I have moved all files that would use the "!include" syntax to there own folder for better orginization and quicker editing.
